# MusicXML2SVG

An ECMAScript 6 Javascript library for converting MusicXML to SVG

## Introduction

The goal of this library is to plublicly develop a minimal library that can render svg directly from a MusicXML file.

The svg will be rendered in a container of type:
```html
<div id="musicxml2svg-container" data-src=" ... link to musixcml file ... ">
    <!-- Place where svg will be rendered--->
</div>
```

Ultimately the goal is to make the library as flexible and extensible as possible in order to allow for additional functionality like audio players, ..
